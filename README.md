# Polo
Here's Polo, which is essentially Uber, but for carpooling.
This application was built using [Kodular](https://www.kodular.io/).

## So what is Polo?
Polo helps a user find someone to car pool with. So it's like booking a cab, except it's free, and helps the environment due to the lower CO2 emissions from people traveling together. In addition, users receive a certain number of points at the end of their ride, which they can trade in for vouchers and coupons available on the app. 
Essentially, we're encouraging our users to carpool.

## What's next for Polo?
This version of Polo is really only the minimal working app, and we intend to work on its features to improve security for users and make it fully functional. The safety features include an OTP system for rides, safety policy agreements and the ability for users to send notifications to request for a specific car (currently, the app automatically assigns the car which is closest to the user, and heading to the same destination) . We'd also want to make Polo something that can be used all over the world, no restrictions.


The .apk file has been uploaded to this repo for testing.
